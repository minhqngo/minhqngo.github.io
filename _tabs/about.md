Welcome technical blog. Here, you will find me sharing about topics that I'm learning, or topics that I have learned in the past but currently need to brush it up so that I don't forget about it. I am an AI engineer, so naturally many posts on this blog will be about topics related to machine learning and deep learning. That being said, I'm interested in computer science as a whole, so you will see me blogging about other topics in computer science too.
